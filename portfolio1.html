              Oladoc.com stands as Pakistan's premier digital healthcare platform, connecting patients with doctors
              seamlessly through online booking, video consultations, and facilitating lab test and medicine bookings. I
              started working at oladoc in January 2020 as a Full Stack Developer, and now I'm a Senior Software
              Engineer. It's been more than four years, and during this time, I've been involved in developing,
              managing, and improving our product. Every day brings new challenges, and I've been learning a lot along
              the way. This journey has been both professionally fulfilling and a great opportunity for personal growth.
